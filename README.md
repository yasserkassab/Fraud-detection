# Fraud-detection
This project implements a fraud detection system using XGBoost and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to improve model interpretability. The dataset consists of anonymized credit card transactions and presents a highly imbalanced classification problem, where fraudulent transactions account for only 0.172% of the total data.
